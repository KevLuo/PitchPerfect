# PitchPerfect

Motivation:
This project exists for people to have some fun with changing how they hear the world around them. Whether it's messing around with friends
or simply just tuning the ears, this app is here as a curious inquiry into the sounds around us.

Description:
PitchPerfect is an iOS app which records people's voices and filters them to create a novel pitch. On the home screen, users are presented
with clean functionality for recording audio. As soon as the stop recording button is selected, the app transitions to another view.
This new view contains six different voice filters, ranging from slow-mo to Darth Vader. Pressing any one of them plays back the recording
with the new filter overlayed.

How to test:
Simple!  Just run the project in Xcode on your computer.
